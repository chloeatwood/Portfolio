            </a>
            <p>This project involved creating a Word Search Generator in C. It is used in a terminal.
                In order to run it you must navigate to the folder location inside your terminal and type:
                <br>make WordSearchGenerator <br> After that you may use it to create a square word search. To do this 
                type ./WordSearchGenerator 'Number of rows/columns you want' 'As many words as you want'. An example 
                of this would be to type: <br> ./WordSearchGenerator 20 Books Chloe WebDevelopment Software Engineer</p>

            </a>
            <p>A game developmet so I could learn Unity. The image is the base of the room you spawn in. Everything in
                the image was created by me in blender. In this game you play as a mouse and need to run around the living 
                room and find all of the cheese before the time runs out. In order to collect all the cheese you must first
                find the cheese that allows you to jump so you can do a little bit of parkour. Be careful as you can only jump 
                high enough to do the parkour for a limited amount of time before you will have to go collect the cheese again. 
                There is one special piece of cheese that must be collected although you might want to save it for last because 
                if you collect it and do not have enough of the other cheese it will respawn.

                <img src="./Images/Cheese.png" alt="Cheese" width="300" class="project-img">
            </a>
            <p>A mobile version of the last game that is played in Augmented Reality. It was created in Unity and utilizes Vuforia. All the same rules apply in this app as in the 
                previous version except you must play it on your phone. Once you load up the app you must scan an image target after putting
                it on the floor in order to spawn the room so you can play. You must the use your phone as your eyes in the game to look around.
                Moving is done by controller buttons on the screen although you may also attempt to walk about in the real world, the game will just
                be a lot harder that way. Be careful, this game may sound fun but it is a lot more difficult in this version than the last.
